Changelog:

v0.4:

Now respects the extra data table in monsters.trs, meaning that file can be edited.
Added #edittrs_origdim.

v0.3:

Fixed check to make sure the .trs file exists before trying to edit it.

v0.2:

Now respects the double resolution image flag. Without this, certain sprites would appear at double size after TRSmodder had touched the .trs they were in.
Added some error handling.
